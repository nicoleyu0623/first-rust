# Stack: memory for local variables

1. values have fixed sizes known at compile time
2. fast: stack pointer
3. follow function calls
4. great memory locality 



# Heap: values that outside of the function calls 

1. values that dynamic sizes determined at the run time
2. slower than the stack
3. no guarantee of memory locality
